### **API Documentation for Frontend Developers**

This documentation outlines the API endpoints and necessary details for integrating the backend functionality into your frontend application. The backend is built using JWT authentication and Cloudinary for image uploads, with endpoints for user authentication, recipe management, and logging out.

---

### **Base URL**
For local development:
```
http://localhost:4000/api
```

---

## **Error Handling**
If an error occurs, you will receive a response in this format:
```json
{
  "status": "ERROR",
  "message": "Error message",
  "data": null
}
```

---

## **Authentication Middleware**
You need to ensure that each request to protected routes (like creating, updating, or deleting recipes) includes the `token` cookie, which will be automatically sent if the user is authenticated.

For requests that involve sensitive operations (like updating or deleting), ensure that the user making the request is the owner of the recipe.

---

### **CORS & Security**
Make sure your frontend app is correctly configured to handle **CORS**. For example:
- Set `withCredentials: true` in Axios requests to ensure cookies are sent for requests made from the frontend.
- Ensure that the cookie is handled securely in a production environment.

---

### **Logout Process**
To log out a user from your frontend, simply make a `POST` request to the `/auth/logout` route and ensure that the userâ€™s cookie is cleared from the client side as well.

```javascript
await fetch("http://localhost:4000/api/auth/logout", {
  method: "POST",
  credentials: "include"  // Send cookies with request
});
```

---

### **Using Cloudinary for Image Upload**
- Ensure you use `FormData` to upload images along with other data.
- In **Postman**, you can upload images by switching the request body type to **form-data** and selecting a file for the `image` field.
